# Start a new data science project

Data Science Projects in RHOAI are used to organize users and AI-application related resources around a single shared space.

1. Start by locating the **Data Science Projects** tab on the menu on the left.
2. Click the **Create project** button. A new window will pop-up.
3. There you can type your preferred project name. In my case, the **Name** will be `ai-edge-project`. Optionally, you can add a description.
4. Then, click **Create**. You will be redirected to the project dashboard page.

With this, a new namespace called `ai-edge-project` will be created in your OpenShift node. Remember that we will use it to deploy all the resources tied to this project.
